# sign-up

In this mini project, I wanted to have a go at using Flexbox to recreate something I found cool and aesthetically pleasing. This simple sign up form, when the window is zoomed in or out, grows and aligns the boxes according to the space available. I used flex-grow and flex-basis to set the growth ratio and widths of the boxes. I think that was the most interesting part, getting the boxes to grow at different rates and the part I found challenging was the CSS styling.

I definitely want to recreate this in a full website in the future as it was something I enjoyed. One thing I'd do differently is create a width slider, so when the boxes wrap the transition is more fluid.
